My dermatologist recommended I use Clindamycin Phosphate topical solution. This is a pad you put on your face You put the pad on the acne for 15 minutes twice a day. This is the absolute worst acne product. When the pimple would go down, it would dent and peel my skin. It totally messed up my skin. Now the area where it dented and peeled my skin, that skin is not growing back. I would stay away from the Clindamycin Phosphate. I might have to get a Collagen implant. First i'm gonna try using moisturizers to see if that will help."

However, eventually, it wore off. I still use it, but its no way as effective as before. So, i was wondering, is there anything else like Clindamycin Topical Solution that i could try? I can't use Zineryt as i have bad reactions to Erythromycin. Any ideas anyone? Also, i have this pimple on my forehead, under my skin, hardly visible... just a small light red patch. Wouldn't normally be that much of a problem, but it really f***ing hurts! Its been there for a couple of days no so hopefulyl its days are now numbered, but anyone got any tips on helping it move any quicker? Thanks in advance, Chester x"

My dermatologist prescribed me both Bactrim Differin Cream (not gel). I was on Retin A Cream(a low % dose - .025%) and Minocycline however I went to see her today and I had some bad pimples and she thought we should switch it up. I should mention that I do get breakout�s here and there but I do not consider it severe acne. I do get some bad pimples at least once a month and they take forever to go away (and stay very red in area�s). Anyways, I wanted to get feedback on both Bactrim Differin and if anyone has used them together??? I did read some bad feedback on Bactrim and that it�s a very strong antibiotic (and some people have had bad side effects). I know its bad to be on antibiotics for a long period of time so I am nervous to go on this one given its stronger. What is consider a long time??? I was on spironolatcote but that messed with my libido so I switched and was put on minocyline and now bactrim. Please let me know your thoughts, advice, feedback!!! Thanks!!!"
