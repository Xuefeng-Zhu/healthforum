This is the official repository for our CS 410 project, currently named "Healthforum". I'm open to any other suggestion of what we should name this proejct and repository.

Here, you will find some initial code for our project. The two folders, client and server, represent the division of the client code and the server (backend) code. 

NOTE: When coding in python, make sure that your tabs are actually tab characters, and not spaces.

To run the server, go to server, and type "./server.py"

hello world
