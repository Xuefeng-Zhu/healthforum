	<p><b>Motivation and Background</b><b>:</b><br/>
	Drug side effects is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. after heart failure, cancer and stroke. Clinical trials can hardly uncover all side effects due to the limited patients and limited time. The post marketing drug safety mainly relies on spontaneous reports to The Food and Drug Administrations (FDA). FDA is hard for patients to use because of the significant mismatch between patient terminology and standard medical vocabularies. Besides, it may take years for FDA to withdraw or restrict dangerous drug. In this project, we try to discover side effects by mining the growing online health forum data where many patients voluntarily report detailed cases about suspicious side effects.</p>

	<p><b>Goal:</b><br/>
	Our healthcare system will mine the drug side effects from online health forum (e.g., <span class="nobr"><a href="http://www.healthboards.com/boards/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthboards.com/boards/<sup><img class="rendericon" src="/images/icons/linkext7.gif" height="7" width="7" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></sup></a></span>) and show the extracted side effects (e.g., Zoloft &#45;&gt; black spots in vision) to potential users including patients, doctors and drug producers.<br/>
	We will build a demo system as our course project and show the demo system in the class in the end of this semester. In term of the problem definition,the input of the system will be the raw text crawled from different online health forums. The output of the system is the structured the drug-symptoms pairs (e.g., Zoloft &#45;&gt; black spots in vision). There are some existing websites that show the side effects of drugs. However, none of them provide the personal cases for patients to better compare and understand their conditions.</p>

	<p><b>Division of Work:</b><br/>
	<b>Front-end group: </b>Xuefeng, Josh, Shiqi, Ran<br/>
	<b>Basic Functionalist:</b><br/>
	1. User search for a drug, show the side effects of that drug and link the posts related to that side effect.<br/>
	Note that there exist some websites that provide the side effects of a given drug. However, none of them show the detail personal cases besides symptom phrases. We link the side effect to the related personal cases to let users better understand what they may feel or compare their conditions with the cases in the forum posts.<br/>
	2. User rates or inputs comments (long free text) describing side effects about a given drug. Front-end read it, send it to back-end and store it in database.<br/>
	This can help us build a very valuable dataset which is a great contribution to the health domain.<br/>
	<b>Advanced Functionalist:</b><br/>
	1. Some visualization tools to visualize our data.<br/>
	2. Side effect prediction: User input a long free text describing his feeling after using a given drug. We perform online text mining and machine learning technique to extract the side effect from the text and predict whether it is related to drug or not based on other user's experience.<br/>
	This is a very interesting problem. User may mis-connected the side effect to a given drug because of &#42;anxiety*. When user is anxiety, he may connect every bad thing he experience to the drug he is taken.<br/>
	3. Drug recommendation: User input a fee text describing his feeling. We predict the disease he has and recommend the drug to him.<br/>
	This is an extremely challenge task. If we can achieve this, we actually build an intelligent  system that can replace doctors. This would bring a very large impact to people.</p>

	<p><b>Back-end group:</b> Henry, Shantanu<br/>
	<b>Basic Functionalist:</b> <br/>
	1. Research group will give you a .txt file contains the drug, its side effects and link to related posts. You may store them in database.<br/>
	2. Write some PHP or Python function to support the request from front-end.<br/>
	Advanced Functionalist:<br/>
	1. Use Lucene to build an index for search.<br/>
	As you can see, the back-end may not be some time-consuming. So I hope you can also devote some time to the research part after finishing back-end work.<br/>
	<b>Research group:</b><br/>
	In the research group, everyone will have individual task to ensure the independent research. Of course, we can discuss together with all the people in our team.<br/>
	<b>Advertisement Robot:</b><br/>
	The goal of system is definitely attract more and more users to use it. So we need to do some advertisement to popularize it. Ran will take charge of writing a robot which automatically "read" the health forum and try to join the discussion about side effect. Our robot will post the link of our website in his post.<br/>
	Here is an example:<br/>
	User A write "I use aspirin and feel black spot in my vision, is that possible?"<br/>
	Our robert will respond "aspirin is known to cause eye problems, weight gain and ... If you need more information, I suggest you go to<span class="nobr"><a href="http://www.uiucsideeffect.com/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">www.uiucSideEffect.com<sup><img class="rendericon" src="/images/icons/linkext7.gif" height="7" width="7" align="absmiddle" alt="" border="0"/></sup></a></span>"<br/>
	<b>Research question:</b><br/>
	1. How to detect user's question related to side effects and drugs? <br/>
	A typical post may contain more than one drugs and more than one side effects. So which side effect is connected to which drug in that posts?<br/>
	2. How to write a attractive and high quality answers so that we can attract more and more users to our website?<br/>
	3. What other &#42;advertisements&#42; we can do for our system?<br/>
	<b>Truth Finding and Rumor Detection in health forum:</b><br/>
	We have extracted lots of side effects from health forums. However are they all truthful? I believe lots of them are rumor and should be detected to relieve patient's anxiety caused by the rumor.<br/>
	<b>Research question:</b><br/>
	1. How to measure the quality of a post, especially in an unsupervised way?<br/>
	2. How to distinguish the rumor and bad-quality information?</p>


	<p><b>Timeline:</b><br/>
	We will finish the basic function in first month and the advanced function in the second month.</p>
